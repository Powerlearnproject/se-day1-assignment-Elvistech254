Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
 -Software engineering is the art and science of designing, building and maintaining software solutions that solve real world problems.
 
Its importance in tech industry include:
 -Designing applications and systems that solve real world problems e.g Jumia to facilitate shopping.
 -Testing and fixing bugs by building secure systems that prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and other vulnerabilities.
 -Write codes that makes things work smoothly and systems to work.
 -Scalability and flexibility by ensuring that systems can handle increased loads without affecting performance.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-Emergence of structured programming; the softwares became easy to understood, logically organized and free from unorganized codes.
-modularity programs got broken down into smaller modules which were manageable making it easier to debug and test.
- The birth of software engineering as a formal discipline and the introduction of software engineering principles.
- The Agile Manifesto and the rise of Agile methodologies. These methodologies emphasized iterative development, frequent customer feedback, flexibility, and close collaboration between teams.
- 
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 -Planning: identify software requirements, purpose and scope.
 -Requirement Analysis: Define final specifications.
  -System Design:Building the software framework detailing how it will meet the requirements.
  -Coding:Converting software design into tangible code
  -Testing:To ensure the software is working and meets the requirements. Test for bugs and glitches.
  -Deployment:Making the software available for use by end users.
  -Maintenance and support:Provide support and updates.
  
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-Waterfall Methodology:In the Waterfall model, each phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) must be completed before moving on to the next. It follows a structured path, making it easy to understand and manage at each stage.
-Agile Methodology:In Agile, work is divided into small, manageable units called sprints (typically 1 to 4 weeks), with each sprint resulting in a potentially shippable product increment. Agile emphasizes collaboration, adaptability, and customer feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-Software developer:Writing codes, maintains software and collaborates with the team.
-Quality Assurance Engineer:Tests software, identifies bugs and ensures quality standards.
-Project Manager:Leads the team, communicates with stakeholders and tracks project progress.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-IDEs:Through tools like Visual Studio Code they help developers write, debug and test code efficiently.
-VCs:Tools like Git enables collaboration, change tracking and error recovery.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Rapid Technological Advancements:They need to be constantly updated and continuously learning.
-Collaboration and communication challenges:They need to hold regular meetings and also to utilise collaborative tools like slack and jira.
-Debugging and Troubleshooting:They should implement log and tools, carry automated tests and pair programming.
-Time constraints:Use Agile Methodologies to manage deadlines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Unit Testing:Tests individual components
-Integration Testing:Ensures modules work together.
-System Testing:Validates the entire system.
-Acceptance Testing:Confirms the software meets user requirements. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- Prompt engineering is the art of asking right, specific and effective inputs (prompts) to interact with AI models like language models, ensuring that the outputs generated are the desired ones and meet the user's needs.
- Importance:It maximizes efficiency, improves accuracy, avoids ambiguity and bias, guides output formart and facilitates collaboration and innovation.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
-Vague Prompt:"Generate an image of a moving car"
-Improved:"Generate an image of a sleek ocean blue AUDI RSQ8 with tinted windows and opened roofdoor moving down a hillside road with sunset behind it"
-Reason:The prompt is clear, concise and very specific mentioning even the sunset and the colour of the car, this makes it easier for the AI model to give the desired output.
